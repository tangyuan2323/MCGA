# Cosmos Whitepaper: Make Cosmos Great Again

## Summary

Cosmos is a protocol aimed at solving the problem of blockchain interoperability by providing a modular and scalable framework that enables different blockchains to communicate and interact with each other. The Make Cosmos Great Again project intends to further advance the development of the Cosmos ecosystem through a series of community activities, user incentive mechanisms, and technological innovations, thereby enhancing community engagement and user participation.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Background

With the continuous advancement of blockchain technology, interoperability among blockchains has emerged as a significant challenge. Cosmos serves as a solution by offering a modular and scalable framework that enables different blockchains to communicate and interact. However, as the project continues to evolve, community building and user engagement have also become important challenges. To further promote the development of the Cosmos ecosystem, we have proposed the Make Cosmos Great Again project.

### 1.2 Project Goals

To enhance the activity level of the Cosmos community and user engagement, and to drive the development and prosperity of the Cosmos ecosystem through a series of community activities, user incentive mechanisms, and technological innovations.

## 2. Project Structure

### 2.1 Community Activity Framework

- **Monthly Online Community Meetings** : Inviting Cosmos core team members and community leaders to share project progress and future plans, and interact with community members.
- **Quarterly Offline Community Gatherings** : Organizing offline events to strengthen communication and collaboration among community members.
- **Community Challenges** : Regularly hosting various challenge events, such as developer hackathons and community design contests, to stimulate creativity and enthusiasm.

### 2.2 User Incentive Mechanism

- **Community Rewards** : Monthly distribution of rewards, including 3 Atom and 500 BLD, to actively participating community members.
- **Developer Incentives** : Encouraging developers to build new applications and tools on the Cosmos ecosystem and providing developer incentive funds.
- **User Feedback Rewards** : Encouraging users to submit valuable feedback and suggestions, and providing corresponding rewards.

### 2.3 Technological Innovation Framework
